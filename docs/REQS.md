# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 

## INTRODUCTION

This is a computational platform for quantum-photonic simulations and optimization.

The main purpose of the whole [research]() is to **explore**, **design** and **optimize** _quantum photonic-integrated components_, focused on **QC**.

For this, **Genetic algorithms** are going to be implemented in order to guide automatically the design optimization, using **quantum performance metrics**.

Finally, the best performance solutions provided by the **Genetic Algorithm** will be analyzed and tested.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Not too much details provided now, but as far we know, the project must be:

- Modular (OOP)
- Python based (The used frameworks works for python)
- Expandable (2D/3D visualizations)
